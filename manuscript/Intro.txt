#Introduction

Welcome to React Native in Depth. We'll cover as much of React Native as possible. From the basics, advanced components, advanced techniques, and anything else needed to help you build your application.

A lot of the basics and how-to use components are documented in the UIExplorer and captured in a few other Examples however we'll tear each thing apart so you completely understand what is going on.

This book assumes you have a basic understanding of React. Creating components, composing components, passing properties, etc. I'll do as much as I can to help if you do not know React but I encourage you to read a few intro tutorials on React before reading this book.

This book will target the latest release of React Native, and I will attempt to keep it as current as possible. The current version of React Native is .90 which brings a lot of changes and improvements.
