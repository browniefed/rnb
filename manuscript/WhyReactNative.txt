# Why React Native

There are a lot of alternatives to React Native, including Phone Gap, NativeScript, Titanium Appcelerator, and many others. One of the major benefits of React Native is the concept of "Learn once write anywhere". Once you learn how to build with React you build things the same way with React Native.

The community for React Native is extremely active. The list of contributors to the React Native core that don't work at Facebook is ever growing. With the ability to bridge Native Views, and Native APIs developers have extended React Natives capabilities beyond what is in the core.

Although Android has yet to be released it is in active development and already in production for the Facebook Ads Manager on Android. Another great reason to select React Native is because Facebook doesn't release something to the open source world unless they've thoroughly tested it in production.

Code reuse is a major aspect of React Native. Code reuse across for both IOS and Android allows you to more easily maintain your applications without hiring multiple teams of developers. Facebook built both the IOS and Android Facebook Ads Manager apps in React Native. They accomplished 87% code resuse from the IOS app when building the Android app.

Ultimately it boils down to an active community, code reuse across platforms, and using the same knowledge base to build both web and mobile applications.
