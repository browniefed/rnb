# Getting Help

You may run into problems and things that aren't covered in this book. If that is the case please let me know so I can cover it and make this a complete book. In the mean time there are some places you can get help.

First start with the React Native Docs here [http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html). I will say they are somewhat complete but there is a significant amount that is currently undocumented.

The second is the reactiflux slack channel, as well as #reactnative on freenode. They are kept in sync with a bot so just choose a preference slack or IRC. The slack link is [https://reactiflux.slack.com/](https://reactiflux.slack.com/) and use your preferable IRC client to connect to #reactnative on freenode.

If you need more in depth help you can ask on StackOverflow here [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/react-native](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/react-native).

For architectural discussions React has a board at [https://discuss.reactjs.org/](https://discuss.reactjs.org/), any help you need with your application should be posted on StackOverflow or on the reactiflux slack.

There may be some cool nugetts of goodness on the twitter #reactnative, which can be found here [https://twitter.com/search?q=#reactnative](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23reactnative).

Finally if you find any bugs post them on the github issues page and they'll be answered, fixed, and or scrubbed as soon as possible. The React Native github issues can be found here [https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues).


# Example Components

There are a few places that show examples, and allow you to find reusable components.

React Rocks ( [http://react.rocks/](http://react.rocks/) ) is great for checking out react web components, as well as some ReactNative examples.

React Parts ( [http://react.parts/native-ios](http://react.parts/native-ios) ) is great for linking directly to the source of the examples but does less in terms of providing live demos.
