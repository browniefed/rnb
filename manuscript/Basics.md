# Basic Components

## Introduction

React Native ships with basic components. This unlike the web which ships with the DOM which provides all the basic components. The basic components that ship with React Native are generally interfaces that refer to the Native components on the mobile device.

## View

If you're coming from the web the `View` component is roughly equivalent to a `div` tag.

## Text

The `Text` component is equivalent to a `span` and in the case of multi-line it could also be a `p` tag.

## Image

The `Image` component is equivalent to the `image` tag on the web. 

## TextInput

The `TextInput` component is equivalent to the `input` tag on the web.
